The key is about the patterns. Attached hex99-3.txt is a text formatted all hex 9x9 patterns. (Actually pattern 2 to pattern 283 are used for hex 8x8 before). The attached text file may contain some extra junk comma mark. I am sure they have been fixed or not.

The file is like followings:
"RN 1",
"BT 14",
"BN 0",
"WM 19 1 2 3 4 10 11 12 13 19 20 21 22 28 29 30 31 37 38 39",
"BM 24",
"ND 3",
"PS 2 5 286",
"PP 2 32 33",
"PP 5 23 16 15 14 8 7 6 5",
"PP 286 9 17 18 25 26 27 34 35 36 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80",
"BN 1",
"WM 9 9 17 18 25 26 27 34 35 36",
"BM 40",
 ....

“RN” is the rule number , same as the pattern number. Pattern 1 (RN 1) is the a hex 9x9 board with center played by black stone (see attached). Pattern 1 has 80 empty positions.
"BT" is total number of branches (if then branch) for the above pattern.
"BN" is the branch number.
"WM" is about white playing positions (first number is the total number of positions)
if white's move fill in any positions in WM, the black will play BM:
"BM" is the black's response move (the following number is position black should play).
After black playing "BM" move, the board will be decomposed.
"ND" the total number of decomposed patterns.
"PS" is the decomposed pattern numbers.
 "PP" is about the decomposed pattern's positions (first number is the decomposed pattern number, later is the decomposed pattern position corresponding to the position of previous pattern. For example, "PP 2 32 33" means this decomposed pattern is pattern 2, its first position is at previous pattern's position 32 and its second position is at previous pattern's position 33.

....
followings "BN 2", ... "BN 3", .... .... "BN 13". They all if than branch of Pattern 1.

......

then ...
"RN 2"....

all in similar way ...

It is because the symmetry of the board, Pattern 1 only need considering 40 positions of 80.

If you start from pattern 1, following all branches of the pattern and go down, you will get all patterns!
